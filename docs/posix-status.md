# POSIX API Compliance Status

This document tracks the implementation status of POSIX APIs in the wasm-posix-kernel. It is organized by subsystem and updated as features are implemented.

**Legend:**
- **Full** — Fully implemented per POSIX spec
- **Partial** — Implemented with documented limitations
- **Stub** — Returns ENOSYS or placeholder
- **Planned** — Not yet started, on roadmap
- **N/A** — Not applicable to Wasm environment

## File Descriptors & I/O

| Function | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `open()` | Partial | Host-delegated. O_CREAT, O_EXCL, O_TRUNC, O_APPEND, O_NONBLOCK, O_CLOEXEC, O_DIRECTORY flags handled. O_NOFOLLOW not yet supported. |
| `openat()` | Planned | Same as open() with AT_FDCWD and relative fd support. |
| `close()` | Partial | Ref-counted OFD cleanup. Host handle closed when last ref dropped. EINTR not yet handled. |
| `read()` | Partial | Host-delegated for files. Pipe reads from kernel ring buffer. Short reads permitted. O_NONBLOCK not yet enforced. |
| `pread()` | Planned | Read at offset without modifying file position. |
| `write()` | Partial | Host-delegated for files. Pipe writes to kernel ring buffer. EPIPE on closed read end. O_APPEND seek-to-end not yet atomic. |
| `pwrite()` | Planned | Write at offset without modifying file position. |
| `lseek()` | Partial | SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR implemented. SEEK_END returns ENOSYS (needs host file size query). |
| `dup()` | Full | Lowest available fd. FD_CLOEXEC cleared. Shares OFD with original. |
| `dup2()` | Full | Atomic close-and-dup. Same-fd no-op. FD_CLOEXEC cleared. |
| `pipe()` | Partial | Kernel-space ring buffer (64KB). PIPE_BUF=4096. Blocking read/write not yet implemented (needs cross-worker IPC). |
| `fstat()` | Partial | Host-delegated for regular files. Pipe returns S_IFIFO | 0o600. Full struct stat populated. |

## fcntl()

| Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `F_DUPFD` | Full | Lowest fd >= arg. FD_CLOEXEC cleared. |
| `F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC` | Full | Atomic dup + set FD_CLOEXEC. |
| `F_GETFD` | Full | Returns FD_CLOEXEC flag. |
| `F_SETFD` | Full | Sets FD_CLOEXEC flag. Per-fd, not per-OFD. |
| `F_GETFL` | Full | Returns status flags + access mode. Use O_ACCMODE mask. |
| `F_SETFL` | Full | Only O_APPEND, O_NONBLOCK modifiable. Access mode bits preserved. |
| `F_GETLK` | Planned | Advisory record locking. Requires kernel lock table. |
| `F_SETLK` | Planned | Non-blocking lock acquisition. |

## Environment-Specific Tradeoffs

Some POSIX APIs have different implementation strategies depending on the host environment. This section documents those tradeoffs.

### SharedArrayBuffer Required

These features require SharedArrayBuffer (and cross-origin isolation headers in browsers):

| Feature | With SAB | Without SAB |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Blocking syscalls | `Atomics.wait()` — true blocking | Asyncify yield — cooperative, adds overhead |
| `fcntl()` locking | Kernel-coordinated via atomic ops | postMessage round-trip, higher latency |
| `pipe()` blocking read | Blocks worker until data available | Asyncify unwind/rewind |
| `nanosleep()` | `Atomics.wait()` with timeout | `setTimeout()` via Asyncify |
| Multi-process shared memory | Direct shared linear memory | Not supported; would need serialization |

### Browser vs Node.js

| Feature | Node.js | Browser |
|---------|---------|---------|
| File I/O | Native `fs` module — full POSIX | OPFS (limited), fetch (read-only), or virtual FS |
| `fork()` | `worker_threads` — feasible | Web Workers — feasible but different API |
| `Atomics.wait()` on main thread | Works | Throws — must use workers |
| Network sockets | `net`/`dgram` modules | WebSocket/WebRTC only (no raw sockets) |
| Process signals | `process.on('SIGINT', ...)` | Not available |
| stdin | `process.stdin` | Requires custom input mechanism |

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1 (Current):** File descriptors & basic I/O — open, close, read, write, lseek, dup, dup2, pipe, fstat, fcntl (flags)
2. **Phase 2:** Directory operations — opendir, readdir, mkdir, stat, chmod, getcwd/chdir
3. **Phase 3:** Process management — fork, exec, waitpid, exit, getpid
4. **Phase 4:** Signals — kill, sigaction, sigprocmask
5. **Phase 5:** fcntl locking — F_GETLK, F_SETLK, F_SETLKW
6. **Phase 6:** Sockets — socket, bind, listen, accept, connect
7. **Phase 7:** Time, TTY, environment
8. **Phase 8:** Memory management — mmap (anonymous), brk
