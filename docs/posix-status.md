# POSIX API Compliance Status

This document tracks the implementation status of POSIX APIs in the wasm-posix-kernel. It is organized by subsystem and updated as features are implemented.

**Legend:**
- **Full** — Fully implemented per POSIX spec
- **Partial** — Implemented with documented limitations
- **Stub** — Returns ENOSYS or placeholder
- **Planned** — Not yet started, on roadmap
- **N/A** — Not applicable to Wasm environment

## File Descriptors & I/O

| Function | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `open()` | Partial | Host-delegated. O_CREAT, O_EXCL, O_TRUNC, O_APPEND, O_NONBLOCK, O_CLOEXEC, O_DIRECTORY, O_NOFOLLOW flags handled. umask applied to mode on O_CREAT. |
| `openat()` | Partial | AT_FDCWD delegates to open(). Absolute paths handled. Relative paths with non-AT_FDCWD dirfd return ENOSYS (requires directory path resolution). |
| `close()` | Partial | Ref-counted OFD cleanup. Host handle closed when last ref dropped. EINTR not yet handled. |
| `read()` | Partial | Host-delegated for files. Pipe/socket reads from kernel ring buffer. Short reads permitted. O_NONBLOCK returns EAGAIN when no data available. |
| `pread()` | Partial | Host-delegated via seek-read-restore. Not atomic (single-threaded safe only). Rejects pipes/sockets with ESPIPE. |
| `write()` | Partial | Host-delegated for files. Pipe writes to kernel ring buffer. EPIPE on closed read end. O_APPEND seek-to-end not yet atomic. |
| `pwrite()` | Partial | Host-delegated via seek-write-restore. Not atomic (single-threaded safe only). Rejects pipes/sockets with ESPIPE. |
| `lseek()` | Full | SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END all implemented. SEEK_END delegates to host for file size calculation. |
| `dup()` | Full | Lowest available fd. FD_CLOEXEC cleared. Shares OFD with original. |
| `dup2()` | Full | Atomic close-and-dup. Same-fd no-op. FD_CLOEXEC cleared. |
| `dup3()` | Full | Like dup2 but returns EINVAL if oldfd==newfd. Supports O_CLOEXEC flag. |
| `pipe()` | Partial | Kernel-space ring buffer (64KB). PIPE_BUF=4096. O_NONBLOCK enforced (EAGAIN). Blocking read/write not yet implemented (needs cross-worker IPC). |
| `pipe2()` | Full | Like pipe with O_NONBLOCK and O_CLOEXEC flag support. |
| `readv()` | Full | Scatter read. Iterates over iovec array calling sys_read for each buffer. Stops on short read or EOF. |
| `writev()` | Full | Gather write. Iterates over iovec array calling sys_write for each buffer. Stops on short write. |
| `fstat()` | Partial | Host-delegated for regular files. Pipe returns S_IFIFO | 0o600. Full struct stat populated. |
| `ftruncate()` | Partial | Host-delegated for regular files with write access. Validates length >= 0. Rejects non-regular fds. |
| `fsync()` | Partial | Host-delegated for regular files. Rejects non-regular fds (pipes, sockets). |

| `F_GETOWN` | Full | Returns async I/O owner PID from OFD. Default 0. |
| `F_SETOWN` | Full | Sets async I/O owner PID on OFD. SIGIO delivery deferred to signal delivery phase. |

## Process Management

| `sigsuspend()` | Planned | Requires blocking + signal delivery mechanism. |
| `raise()` | Full | Equivalent to kill(getpid(), sig). |

## Environment-Specific Tradeoffs

Some POSIX APIs have different implementation strategies depending on the host environment. This section documents those tradeoffs.

### SharedArrayBuffer Required

These features require SharedArrayBuffer (and cross-origin isolation headers in browsers):

| Feature | With SAB | Without SAB |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Blocking syscalls | `Atomics.wait()` — true blocking | Asyncify yield — cooperative, adds overhead |
| `fcntl()` locking | Kernel-coordinated via atomic ops | postMessage round-trip, higher latency |
| `pipe()` blocking read | Blocks worker until data available | Asyncify unwind/rewind |
| `nanosleep()` | `Atomics.wait()` with timeout | `setTimeout()` via Asyncify |
| Multi-process shared memory | Direct shared linear memory | Not supported; would need serialization |

### Browser vs Node.js

| Feature | Node.js | Browser |
|---------|---------|---------|
| File I/O | Native `fs` module — full POSIX | OPFS (limited), fetch (read-only), or virtual FS |
| `fork()` | `worker_threads` — feasible | Web Workers — feasible but different API |
| `Atomics.wait()` on main thread | Works | Throws — must use workers |
| Network sockets | `net`/`dgram` modules | WebSocket/WebRTC only (no raw sockets) |
| Process signals | `process.on('SIGINT', ...)` | Not available |
| stdin | `process.stdin` | Requires custom input mechanism |
