# Browser Support

> **Contributor note — dual-host parity is load-bearing.** The browser host is a peer of the Node.js host, not a follower. Any change touching host-runtime behavior MUST land symmetrically on both hosts, **in the same PR**. See [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md#two-hosts-browser-and-nodejs--dual-host-parity-is-load-bearing) for the hard requirements. PR #388 (brk-base) and PR #410 (worker exit message) both shipped one-sided fixes that left the browser demo broken for users; those are the failure modes this rule exists to prevent.

## Overview

Kandelo runs in modern browsers with SharedArrayBuffer support (Chrome 91+, Firefox 79+, Safari 16.4+). The centralized kernel architecture uses one kernel Wasm instance in a dedicated web worker, with each process running in a sub-worker.

## Required HTTP Headers

SharedArrayBuffer requires cross-origin isolation:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Without these headers, `SharedArrayBuffer` is undefined and the kernel cannot initialize.

## Architecture

The kernel runs in a dedicated web worker, freeing the main thread for UI rendering and coordination only. The main thread uses `BrowserKernel` as a thin proxy that communicates with the kernel worker via `postMessage`.

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `BrowserKernel` | Main thread | Thin proxy — sends messages to kernel worker |
| `kernel-worker-entry.ts` | Kernel worker | Hosts CentralizedKernelWorker, process lifecycle |
| `CentralizedKernelWorker` | Kernel worker | Kernel instance, handles all syscalls |
| Process Workers | Sub-workers of kernel worker | One per process, communicates via SharedArrayBuffer + Atomics |
| Service Worker | Separate | Intercepts HTTP for nginx/WordPress demos |
| Connection pump | Kernel worker | Bridges HTTP requests to kernel TCP pipes |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Kernel in dedicated worker**: Enables `Atomics.waitAsync` without V8 microtask chain freeze bug (main-thread-only). No need for MessageChannel-based polling. Zero UI jank regardless of syscall load.
- **Kernel-owned VFS** (preferred path, `kernelOwnedFs: true` + `kernel.boot()`): the kernel worker restores a pre-built VFS image and exec()s `argv[0]` as the first process. The main thread never instantiates a `MemoryFileSystem` and is not in the FS hot path. Service-supervised demos run dinit (PID 1) inside this image; single-program demos exec the language interpreter directly.
- **Legacy shared VFS** (`memfs:` constructor option + `kernel.spawn()`): main thread holds a `MemoryFileSystem` and shares the SAB with the kernel worker. Used by demos that fetch transient binaries at runtime (test runners, REPLs that load arbitrary user code, benchmark suites). Kept in place until the kernel grows a "spawn-into-running-kernel" path that doesn't need a main-thread pid.
- **Exec reads from filesystem**: Like a real OS, `exec()` reads binaries from the kernel-side `MemoryFileSystem`. Programs are baked into the VFS image at build time (or written by the page in the legacy path before spawning). Symlinks are used for multicall binaries (e.g., coreutils).
- **dinit (PID 1) for service supervision**: Multi-process demos (nginx, redis, mariadb, nginx-php, wordpress, lamp, mariadb-test) bake `/sbin/dinit` and per-service files under `/etc/dinit.d/` into the VFS image via `addDinitInit()` (`examples/browser/scripts/dinit-image-helpers.ts`). dinit handles SIGCHLD reaping, `depends-on` ordering, and bootstrap-then-daemon chains. Page code waits for service-ready via `onListenTcp` (port-bind) callbacks, then starts driving the demo over kernel-loopback TCP or the HTTP bridge.
- **Connection pump in kernel worker**: HTTP↔TCP bridge runs inside the kernel worker with synchronous pipe I/O (direct Wasm export calls). Service worker transfers a MessagePort to the kernel worker for HTTP request delivery.
- **App clients on main thread**: MySQL and Redis wire protocol clients stay on the main thread and use async pipe operations via the message protocol.

### Syscall Flow

```
Process Worker → SharedArrayBuffer channel → Atomics.notify
→ CentralizedKernelWorker.handleChannel() → kernel_handle_channel()
→ result written to channel → Atomics.notify → Process Worker resumes
```

### HTTP Request Flow (nginx/WordPress demos)

```
Browser fetch → Service Worker intercepts
→ MessagePort → Kernel Worker (connection pump)
→ kernel_inject_connection() → pipe write (raw HTTP)
→ nginx (Wasm) accepts, processes → pipe read (response)
→ MessagePort → Service Worker → browser Response
```

## Capabilities

### Multi-Process
- `fork()` via Asyncify snapshot/restore — child runs in new sub-worker with copied memory
- `exec()` reads program binary from the shared filesystem, replaces process
- `posix_spawn()` — fork+exec with file actions (addchdir, addfchdir, addclose, adddup2)
- Process groups, wait/waitpid, cross-process signals, pipes

### Threads
- `clone()` with `CLONE_VM|CLONE_THREAD` — shared Memory between parent and thread Workers
- Used by MariaDB (5 threads), Redis (3 background threads)

### Networking
- TCP via kernel pipe-backed connections
- Service worker cookie jar for session persistence (WordPress)
- nginx serves static files and proxies to PHP-FPM via loopback TCP

### Filesystem
- `MemoryFileSystem` — SharedArrayBuffer-based VFS shared between main thread and kernel worker
- `OpfsFileSystem` — Origin Private File System for browser persistence
- `DeviceFileSystem` — `/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, `/dev/urandom`, `/dev/ptmx`

### Terminal
- PTY support with full line discipline
- Interactive stdin via `appendStdinData` for incremental input
- xterm.js integration via `PtyTerminal`

### Framebuffer (`/dev/fb0`)
- 640×400 BGRA32 packed-pixel framebuffer; single-process owner.
- The pixel buffer lives in the process's `WebAssembly.Memory` (a `SharedArrayBuffer`); the kernel notifies the host of `(pid, addr, len, w, h, stride, fmt)` on `mmap`, and the host renders via `requestAnimationFrame` + a 2D-canvas `putImageData` per frame.
- `host/src/framebuffer/canvas-renderer.ts::attachCanvas(canvas, registry, pid, opts)` is the consumer-side renderer.
- Keyboard input: the demo page maps browser `KeyboardEvent.code` to AT-set-1 scancodes and feeds them through `appendStdinData(pid, …)`; fbDOOM-style software (which puts the tty into MEDIUMRAW mode) decodes those bytes as scancodes.
- Limitations: `fork` does not auto-bind the child; multi-buffering / vsync via `FBIOPAN_DISPLAY` is a no-op.

### Mouse input (`/dev/input/mice`)
- Demo pages attach `mousemove` / `mousedown` / `mouseup` listeners to the canvas and call `BrowserKernel.injectMouseEvent(dx, dy, buttons)`. The main thread posts a `mouse_inject` message to the kernel worker, which calls the kernel's `kernel_inject_mouse_event` export. The kernel encodes a 3-byte PS/2 frame and queues it on a global ring; user processes drain the queue via `read("/dev/input/mice", …)`.
- **Pointer Lock recommended.** The DOOM demo calls `canvas.requestPointerLock()` on first click so the browser delivers unbounded relative motion (`MouseEvent.movementX/Y`). Without pointer lock, `clientX/Y` deltas clamp at the canvas edges and feel sluggish for first-person controls. Press `Esc` to release the lock.
- Browser `deltaY` is positive-down; the demo inverts it before injection so the kernel queue holds canonical PS/2 (positive-up) deltas.
- Browser `MouseEvent.button` (0=L, 1=M, 2=R) is mapped to PS/2 button bits (bit0=L, bit1=R, bit2=M). Right-click suppresses the browser context menu via `contextmenu` `preventDefault()`.
- Single-owner device (one process can hold `/dev/input/mice` open at a time; second open from another pid returns `EBUSY`).

### Audio output (`/dev/dsp`)
- The kernel exposes an OSS-style `/dev/dsp` character device. User programs `open(O_WRONLY)`, configure rate / channels / format via `SNDCTL_DSP_*` ioctls, and `write()` interleaved 16-bit-LE PCM. The kernel buffers samples in a 256 KiB ring (~1.5 s of stereo S16 @ 44.1 kHz). On overflow the *oldest* whole frame drops — same trade-off real OSS hardware makes under hardware overrun.
- Demo pages drive a `setInterval` loop (~50 ms cadence) that calls `BrowserKernel.drainAudio(maxBytes)`. The kernel-worker drains the ring via the `kernel_drain_audio` wasm export (which respects whole-frame boundaries so stereo L/R never tear) and posts the bytes back. Main thread converts S16 → Float32, builds an `AudioBuffer`, and schedules an `AudioBufferSourceNode` on the `AudioContext` clock with a small lookahead so brief drain hiccups don't underrun.
- Single-owner device. Owner is released on close-of-last-fd / `execve` / `exit`; the ring is flushed at the same time so a successor open starts from silence. Format must be `AFMT_S16_LE`; other formats are `EINVAL`.
- **AudioContext gesture requirement.** `new AudioContext()` starts suspended in modern browsers and only resumes after a user gesture. The DOOM demo creates the context immediately after the user's "Start" click (which is itself a gesture), so `audioCtx.resume()` succeeds without a separate prompt.

The shareware `doom1.wad` is **fetched at page load** from a Linux-distro mirror (SHA-256 verified, Cache API cached); no IWAD ships in the package archive. |

The "Boot pattern" column reflects how the demo enters the kernel:
- **`kernel.boot`** — `kernelOwnedFs: true`, exec the language interpreter as the first process.
- **dinit** — `kernelOwnedFs: true`, exec dinit (PID 1), which brings up the per-demo service tree.
- **dinit + spawn** — dinit boots the supervised services; the page spawns transient binaries (e.g. mysqltest) via `kernel.spawn()`.
- **legacy spawn** — main thread restores a `MemoryFileSystem`, page calls `kernel.spawn(programBytes, argv)` for each binary.

Run demos: `cd examples/browser && npx vite --port 5198`

## VFS Images

Browser demos use pre-built **VFS images** — binary snapshots of a `MemoryFileSystem` containing all runtime files, directory structure, configs, and symlinks needed by a demo. At runtime, restoring a VFS image is a single buffer copy, replacing what would otherwise be hundreds or thousands of individual file creation operations.

### How it works

1. **Build time**: A TypeScript build script creates a `MemoryFileSystem`, writes files/dirs/symlinks into it, and calls `saveImage()` to produce a zstd-compressed `.vfs.zst` file. Empty regions of the SharedFS allocator compress to nearly nothing, so a 32 MB filesystem with a few MB of real content typically ships as a 1–3 MB download.
2. **Runtime**: The demo page fetches the `.vfs.zst` file, calls `MemoryFileSystem.fromImage(imageBytes, { maxByteLength })` (which auto-detects zstd magic and decompresses transparently), and passes the resulting filesystem to `BrowserKernel({ memfs })`.

```typescript
// Typical demo pattern
const [kernelBuf, vfsImageBuf] = await Promise.all([
  fetch(kernelUrl).then(r => r.arrayBuffer()),
  fetch(vfsImageUrl).then(r => r.arrayBuffer()),
]);

const memfs = MemoryFileSystem.fromImage(
  new Uint8Array(vfsImageBuf),
  { maxByteLength: 512 * 1024 * 1024 },
);

const kernel = await BrowserKernel.create({ kernelWasm: kernelBuf, memfs });
```

### VFS images per demo

| Demo | Image | Build command | What's inside |
|------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Python | `python.vfs.zst` | `bash examples/browser/scripts/build-python-vfs-image.sh` | CPython stdlib |
| Erlang | `erlang.vfs.zst` | `bash examples/browser/scripts/build-erlang-vfs-image.sh` | OTP runtime |
| Perl | `perl.vfs.zst` | `bash examples/browser/scripts/build-perl-vfs-image.sh` | Perl stdlib |
| Shell | `shell.vfs.zst` | `bash examples/browser/scripts/build-shell-vfs-image.sh` | dash, symlinks, vim runtime |
| Node | `node.vfs.zst` | `bash examples/browser/scripts/build-node-vfs-image.sh` | npm 10.9.2 dist + writable `/work` |
| WordPress | `wordpress.vfs.zst` | `bash examples/browser/scripts/build-wp-vfs-image.sh` | WP files, nginx/PHP configs |
| LAMP | `lamp.vfs.zst` | `bash examples/browser/scripts/build-lamp-vfs-image.sh` | MariaDB + WP + configs |
| MariaDB test | `mariadb-test.vfs.zst` | `bash examples/browser/scripts/build-mariadb-test-vfs-image.sh` | MariaDB + test suite |

VFS images are `.gitignore`d and must be built locally. The `run.sh` script handles this automatically (e.g., `./run.sh browser` builds any missing VFS images before starting the dev server).

### Building VFS images

Each build script requires the corresponding software to be compiled first (e.g., `build-cpython.sh` before `build-python-vfs-image.sh`). The `run.sh` script orchestrates this:

```bash
./run.sh build python-vfs    # Build Python VFS image
./run.sh build shell-vfs     # Build Shell VFS image
./run.sh build all            # Build everything including all VFS images
```

### Adding a new VFS image

1. Create `examples/browser/scripts/build-<name>-vfs-image.ts` — import helpers from `vfs-image-helpers.ts`
2. Create `examples/browser/scripts/build-<name>-vfs-image.sh` — shell wrapper that runs the TypeScript script
3. Update the demo's `main.ts` to fetch the `.vfs.zst` file and use `MemoryFileSystem.fromImage()` (which auto-decompresses)
4. Add a build target in `run.sh`

The shared helpers in `vfs-image-helpers.ts` provide:
- `writeVfsFile(fs, path, content)` / `writeVfsBinary(fs, path, data)` — write files
- `ensureDirRecursive(fs, path)` — create directory trees
- `symlink(fs, target, path)` — create symlinks
- `walkAndWrite(fs, hostDir, mountPrefix, opts?)` — recursively walk a host directory into the VFS
- `saveImage(fs, outFile)` — save and write the image to disk

## Vite Configuration

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default {
  server: {
    headers: {
      "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin",
      "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "require-corp",
    },
  },
};
```

## Known Limitations

### SharedArrayBuffer restrictions
Chrome rejects SharedArrayBuffer-backed views in `TextDecoder.decode()` and `crypto.getRandomValues()`. Always copy to a temporary non-shared buffer first.

### No raw server sockets
Browser sandbox prevents listening on ports. nginx/PHP-FPM demos use a service worker to intercept HTTP requests and inject them as kernel TCP connections via the connection pump.

### Memory per process
Each process gets `WebAssembly.Memory(shared: true, initial: maxPages, max: maxPages)`. Shared memory reserves the full virtual address space at construction time, so `maxMemoryPages` should be tuned for multi-process demos (e.g., 4096 pages = 256MB for WordPress with 5+ processes).

### npm registry access in the browser
The node demo's `npm install` cannot speak HTTPS to `registry.npmjs.org` directly: the in-JS TLS-MITM backend triggers a QuickJS-NG cycle-GC bug on large packuments. Instead, the page sets `--registry=http://proxy.local/`, the kernel resolves `proxy.local` via `host_getaddrinfo` (it is deliberately absent from the synthetic `/etc/hosts`), and the host-side TLS backend re-routes those requests through the existing cors-proxy (dev) or service worker (prod) onto `https://registry.npmjs.org/`. Tarball URLs in JSON responses are rewritten to the same alias so subsequent fetches stay on the plaintext path. The QuickJS-NG fix that makes the TLS path safe in principle is in `examples/libs/quickjs/patches/0001-fix-mapped-arguments-mark-attached-var-refs.patch`.
