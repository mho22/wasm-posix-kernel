//! `/dev/input/mice` — Linux-compatible PS/2 mouse stream.
//!
//! Surface mirrors what the Linux `mousedev` driver exposes: a character
//! device that yields PS/2 mouse packets to user-space readers. The
//! kernel does not generate motion itself — the host injects events via
//! [`inject_event`] (translated from browser `mousemove` / `mousedown` /
//! `mouseup` events on a canvas).
//!
//! ## Protocol
//!
//! Standard 3-byte PS/2 mouse packet — what `/dev/input/mice` emits in
//! its default mode (no IMPS/2 magic-knock for wheel support yet):
//!
//! ```text
//!     bit  7      6      5     4     3    2    1    0
//!  byte0  YOVF  XOVF  YSIGN XSIGN  ALW1 MID  RIGHT LEFT
//!  byte1  signed dx  (-128..127)
//!  byte2  signed dy  (-128..127)  — POSITIVE = mouse moved UP
//! ```
//!
//! Bit 3 of byte0 is always 1 (PS/2 frame sync). Bit 4 = X sign, bit 5 =
//! Y sign — mouseutils-style signed-magnitude encoding rather than two's
//! complement; we set the sign bit to mirror the high bit of the dx/dy
//! byte so a naive reader that just treats the byte as `int8_t` still
//! gets the right value.
//!
//! Y is reported with positive = up to match Linux mousedev. Browser
//! mouse coordinates have positive = down, so the canvas listener
//! inverts dy before calling `BrowserKernel.injectMouseEvent`.
//!
//! ## Single-owner
//!
//! The device is single-open. A second `open` from a different pid
//! returns `EBUSY`. Re-opens by the current owner are allowed (mirrors
//! Linux mousedev's exclusive-grab semantics for our single-process
//! model). Owner is released when the process closes its last
//! `/dev/input/mice` fd, or exits.
//!
//! Multi-fd within one process shares the queue — packets are consumed
//! in order regardless of which fd reads first. fbDOOM, the only
//! consumer here today, opens the device once.
